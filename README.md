## 📦 Software Stack

- **OS**: Zephyr RTOS (v3.7)
- **GUI**: LVGL (embedded graphics library)
- **BLE**: Nordic UART Service (NUS)
- **Drivers**:
  - I²C for sensors (MAX30102, BMI160)
  - Custom LVGL widgets for data visualization

## 🔄 BLE Communication

### 📱 Mobile App Integration
- **Data Stream**: Heart rate and steps sent periodically via NUS.
- **Time Sync**: Mobile app sends `TIME:HH:MM:SS` to update MCU clock.

### 🧭 BLE Commands

| Command       | Description                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `watchface1`  | Switch to default watchface                      |
| `w1hr`        | Watchface 1 with heart rate monitor              |
| `w1steps`     | Watchface 1 with steps monitor                   |
| `enablecd`    | Enable **wrist flick gesture** to change screen  |
| `disablecd`   | Disable wrist-based display switching            |

### Compatibility:
1. **nRF Toolbox** (UART mode)
2. **MIT App Inventor** (custom BLE app)
3. **Native Android App** (WIP, uses BLE API)

## ✋ Display Change on Wrist Flick

This feature allows changing the display screen by flicking your wrist, using the onboard accelerometer to detect motion.

- **Enable via BLE**: `enablecd`
- **Disable via BLE**: `disablecd`
- Internally uses accelerometer interrupt/motion threshold to trigger screen transitions.
